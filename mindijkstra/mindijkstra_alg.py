    """
    Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a starting vertex to all other vertices
    in a weighted graph. The graph is represented using an adjacency list.

    Args:
        start (int): The starting vertex index.
        edges (list of list): An adjacency list where each index represents a vertex, and each entry
                              is a list of [destination, weight] pairs.

    Returns:
        list: A list of minimum distances from the starting vertex to each vertex in the graph.
              If a vertex is unreachable, its distance is represented as -1.
