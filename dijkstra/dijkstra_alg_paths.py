def dijkstrasAlgorithmWithPaths(start, edges):
    """
    Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph.

        start (int): The starting node index.
        edges (list of list): Adjacency list representing the graph. Each index corresponds to a vertex,
                              and each entry is a list of pairs [destination, weight].

        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - minDistances (list): A list of the shortest distances from the starting node to each node.
                                   If a node is unreachable, its distance is `inf`.

                                    in the shortest path. `None` if no path exists.
